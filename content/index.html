<p class="sectiontitle">Meeting Abstract:</p>
</td><td style="width:73%;">
<p> The purpose of this talk is to share my field experience in
establishing web acceptance test suites with high return on investment
(ROI) for web application. My ThoughtWorks team successfully
transformed a 3 hours web testing suite that despite high maintenance
efforts was always red,  into a passing sub-20 minutes build that
provides quick and accurate feedback while requiring minimal
maintenance. This session covers best practices and tools that you can
put in place to achieve your own success story.</p>

<p>In my experience, attaining high value from traditional acceptance web
testing is hard to accomplish mainly because:
<ul>
  <li>Tests are brittle: In other words they keep failing and require a
lot of maintenance over the course of the
iterations -- even when your application has no new defects!</li>
  <li>Testing is slow: Web acceptance testing involves a full
application stack and a flurry of network chats between
   browsers, web servers, databases and other processes. Not
surprisingly this comes with a lot of performance overhead
   and the environment requires a non-trivial set up. Consequently a
web acceptance build typically takes hours to run
and accounts for a tremendous delay in development feedback.</li>
  <li>It is difficult to assess the exact impact of current failures in
terms of actual application functionality:
   A single UI change in a "hub-page" (say the login page) can cause
most of the test suite to fail while from the
user's perspective, the application is working just fine.</li>
  <li>Some application states are hard, if not impossible, to reach
solely from the UI. The traditional approach here
   has been either to avoid testing these cases or to write tests
that rely on large, complex and well-known data
sets, which become increasingly harder to maintain and comprehend.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
I will discuss how to address these issues by leveraging tools such as
Selenium Grid (http://openqa.org/selenium-grid),
DeepTest (http://deep-test.rubyforge.org) while implementing
innovative best practices such as:
<ul>
  <li>Keeping the build blazing fast by leveraging cheap hardware and
  aggressively parallelizing test runs.</li>
  <li>Implementing aggressive test isolation.</li>
  <li>Putting the Web acceptance tests in total control of the application state.</li>
  <li>Keeping the tests razor sharp.</li>
</ul>

    <p>
    <a href="http://ph7spot.com/">Philippe Hanrigou</a> has over ten years of experience developing enterprise
      software and web applications. As a software engineer and 
      <a href="http://thoughtworks.com">ThoughtWorks</a>

      consultant, he focuses on designing enterprise software ¡ª understanding
      what makes a good design and implementing practices that encourage it. For
      the last 2 years he has enthusiastically embraced Ruby and used it to
      deliver large enterprise systems.
    </p><p>      
      Philippe is the author of 
      <a href="/publications/troubleshooting_ruby_processes"><q>Troubleshooting Ruby
      Processes</q></a>,
      an Addison-Wesley Ruby Professional Series shortcut, that introduces key
      system diagnostic tools in the context of Ruby development. Philippe is
      also the principal developer and author of 
      <a href="http://selenium-grid.openqa.org">Selenium Grid</a>, 
      a tool that transparently
      distribute your web testing infrastructure so that you can run Selenium
      tests in parallel.
    </p><p>
      Philippe continually seeks ways to improve the state of the software craft
      and has found agile methodologies to be especially efficient and rewarding
      for developing enterprise software. He spends much of his time sharpening
      his expertise in this area and advocating agile methodologies.
